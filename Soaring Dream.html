Fabulous air show of Paris in motion <br> 
My thought too in flight and yearns for my Nation<br>  
When will the planes designed in my land <br> 
Pierce the sky as lightening in action<br>  
And gracefully land as angels in full boom <br> 
All to the envy of spellbound spectators<br>  
Yes we can !!<br>  
When we are united in action and addicted to deeds<br>  
Sky can’t be limit for my nation in action !<br>
