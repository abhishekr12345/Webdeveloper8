    Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is one of the most celebrated festivals in India.
    It symbolizes the victory of light over darkness and good over evil. Homes are decorated with diyas,
    rangoli, and colorful lights. Families come together to share sweets, burst fireworks, and celebrate
    with joy and devotion.
